To start your db create you db and name it midterm on psql (just that)
Then run ```npm run db:reset``` if you have the files in ```db/schema``` and ```db/seeds``` with the new data downloaded it will work 

All the functions that converts the query to js are in the ```db/queries/users.js``` file

You will have to create a file for each route and put them in the server.js file (look at routes folder for example)

The script for the front end is in public/scripts
